# 120-Day FAANG-Focused Study Plan

## Phase 1: Problem-Solving and Core Concepts (Days 1–30)

### **Goal**: Master data structures, algorithms, and foundational programming skills.

### Week 1
- **Data Structures**: Focus on arrays, strings, and linked lists. Solve 5–7 problems daily on LeetCode (Easy/Medium).
- **Algorithms**: Learn sorting and searching algorithms. Implement from scratch (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search).
- **Programming**: Polish Python and JavaScript skills. Practice writing clean, modular, and efficient code.

### Week 2
- **Data Structures**: Master stacks, queues, and hash maps. Solve LeetCode problems focusing on these.
- **Algorithms**: Study recursion and dynamic programming. Solve classic problems (e.g., Fibonacci, coin change).
- **Mock Interviews**: Begin timing problem-solving sessions to simulate interview conditions.

### Week 3
- **Data Structures**: Dive into binary trees and graphs. Focus on traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).
- **System Design**: Learn the basics of designing scalable systems (load balancers, database sharding).
- **Coding Challenges**: Solve FAANG-style problems on platforms like Codeforces or HackerRank.

### Week 4
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Learn sliding window, two-pointer techniques, and backtracking.
- **Behavioral Prep**: Begin drafting STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) stories for behavioral interviews.
- **Project Setup**: Start brainstorming a significant full-stack project integrating AI (e.g., an AI-powered recommendation engine).

## Phase 2: Full-Stack + AI Integration (Days 31–75)

### **Goal**: Build scalable full-stack apps and integrate AI models to showcase practical expertise.

### Week 5-6
- **Frontend**: Master React.js (components, hooks, state management with Redux/Context API).
- **Backend**: Learn Node.js and Express.js. Set up REST APIs with authentication (JWT).
- **AI**: Build a basic machine learning model with scikit-learn (e.g., regression or classification). Deploy it as an API.

### Week 7-8
- **Frontend**: Dive into advanced concepts like server-side rendering (Next.js).
- **Backend**: Learn GraphQL. Build APIs and integrate them with React.
- **AI**: Explore TensorFlow or PyTorch. Build and train a neural network (e.g., image recognition).

### Week 9-10
- **System Design**: Design and implement scalable systems (e.g., Netflix-like streaming service). Focus on distributed systems and caching strategies (Redis, CDN).
- **AI**: Fine-tune pre-trained models like BERT or ResNet. Use these in your backend API for advanced features (e.g., text summarization, image tagging).
- **Integration**: Deploy your app (e.g., Vercel for frontend, AWS/GCP for backend) and connect it to your AI API.

## Phase 3: Advanced Systems and Portfolio (Days 76–120)

### **Goal**: Gain expertise in distributed systems, optimize projects, and prepare for interviews.

### Week 11-12
- **Distributed Systems**: Study database partitioning, CAP theorem, and eventual consistency.
- **AI Deployment**: Optimize AI models for production (convert to TensorFlow.js, ONNX). Deploy models to cloud or edge.
- **Project**: Build an AI-driven dashboard (e.g., predictive analytics for a business domain).

### Week 13-14
- **System Design**: Focus on FAANG system design questions (e.g., design YouTube, Instagram). Practice explaining design decisions and trade-offs.
- **Coding Interviews**: Solve FAANG-style algorithm problems daily. Practice mock interviews under timed conditions.
- **Portfolio**: Document your projects with case studies (tech stack, challenges, solutions). Host on GitHub with a custom domain.

### Week 15-16
- **Mock Interviews**: Schedule system design and coding interview mocks. Simulate behavioral rounds.
- **Refinement**: Polish your resume, LinkedIn, and portfolio. Highlight leadership, AI expertise, and full-stack experience.
- **Final Practice**: Solve problems from real FAANG interview experiences on Glassdoor or Blind.
